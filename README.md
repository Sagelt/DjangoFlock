===========

So, Games on Demand is pretty cool, but there's not really any _demand_ there. It's more "Games we feel like running". I'm making this to support people petitioning for games they want to play, but not run. Currently, it's just a game scheduler, but more features coming!

Todo
----

 - Add inline creation of Publishers and Games, through Ajax.
 - Move to MongoDB backend. (Maybe, in the future.)
 - Make Demand view actually do what it should (show demand per hour per game).
