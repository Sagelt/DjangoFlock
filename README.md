===========

So, Games on Demand is pretty cool, but there's not really any _demand_ there. It's more "Games we feel like running". I'm making this to support people petitioning for games they want to play, but not run. Currently, it's just a game scheduler, but more features coming!

Todo
----

 - Add inline creation of Publishers and Games, through Ajax.
 - Move to MongoDB backend. (Maybe, in the future.)
 - Make Demand view actually do what it should (show demand per hour per game).
 - Notify people when games they've expressed interest in are being run.
 - Get a real favicon.
 - Decide on a name. RPGflock? Constellator?
 - Publish events to per-Convention gCal/iCal/whatever it is format.
 - Factor out modal forms into partials, group relevant javascript with them, use include tags.
 - Make Convention implicit; set your current convention in your user profile, have all data filtered to show just your convention, have top-banner status show your current convention.
 - Make user profiles.
